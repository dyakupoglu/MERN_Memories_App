# MERN Memories App
<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I developed a Full Stack MERN Application using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB. The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives. I already know the frontend side of an application or website but while developing this application I have learned the backend side and connect database. Furthermore, I have learned the Redux library using it in my application.
